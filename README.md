##Clothing Store

## Description of the Project
This project is a backend e-commerce application for a Clothing Store.
I worked as a backend developer on an existing Spring Boot API that uses a MySQL database for data storage. 
The front-end webstore was already built, and my role was to modify and extend the API to support the store’s functionality. 
All API endpoints were tested using Postman/Insomnia, with the provided front-end used for validation when needed.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

-As a user I want to view all available product categories, so that I can browse the store easily.
-As a user I want to view all products in a selected category, so that I can narrow down my choices.
-As an Admin I want to add a new category, so that I can organize products.
-As an admin I want to update or delete categories, so that the catalog stays accurate.
